Assignment:

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology.

> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]


How bubble sort works:

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that starts from the first element of an array and compares it with the second element.
If the first element is greater than the second, we swap them.
It continues this process until the end of the array, with the largest elements “bubbling” to the top.
