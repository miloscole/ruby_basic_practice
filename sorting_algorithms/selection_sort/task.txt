Assignment:

Build a method #selection_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the selection sort methodology.

> selection_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]


How selection sort works:

Selection works by taking the smallest element in an unsorted array and bringing it to the front.
You'll go through each item (from left to right) until you find the smallest one.
The first item in the array is now sorted, while the rest of the array is unsorted.
