Assignment:

Build a method #merge_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the merge sort methodology.

> merge_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]


How merge sort works:

It follows the divide-and-conquer approach to sort a given array of elements.

1. Divide: Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
2. Conquer: Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm.
3. Merge: The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order.
   The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged.
